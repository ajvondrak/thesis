\subsection{Combinators}\label{sec:primer:combinators}

Quotations, introduced in \cref{sec:primer:stack-based}, form the basis of both
control flow and data flow in Factor.  Not only are they the equivalent of
anonymous functions, but the stack model also makes them syntactically
lightweight enough to serve as blocks akin to the code between curly braces in
C or Java.  Higher-order words that make use of quotations on the stack are
called \term{combinators}.  It's simple to express familiar conditional logic
and loops using combinators, as we'll show in \cref{sec:primer:control-flow}.
In the presence of explicit data flow via stack operations, even more patterns
arise that can be abstracted away.  \cref{sec:primer:data-flow} explores how we
can use combinators to express otherwise convoluted stack-shuffling logic more
succinctly.

\subsubsection{Control Flow}\label{sec:primer:control-flow}

\inputlst{if}

The most primitive form of control flow in typical programming languages is, of
course, the \mint{java}|if| statement, and the same holds true for Factor.  The
only difference is that Factor's \factor|if| isn't syntactically
significant---it's just another word, albeit implemented as a primitive.  For
the moment, it will do to think of \factor|if| as having the stack effect
%
\Verb|( ? true false -- )|.
%
The third element from the top of the stack is a condition, and it's followed
by two quotations.  The first quotation (second element from the top of the
stack) is called if the condition is true, and the second quotation (the top of
the stack) is called if the condition is false.  Specifically, \factor|f| is a
special object in Factor.  It is a singleton object---the sole instance of the
\factor|f| class---and is the only false value in the entire language.  Any
other object is necessarily boolean true.  For a canonical boolean, there is
the \factor|t| object, but its truth value exists only because it is not
\factor|f|.  Basic \factor|if| use is shown in \cref{lst:if}\todo{vref}.  The
first example will print ``odd'', the second ``empty'', and the third ``isn't
f''.  All of them leave nothing on the stack.

\inputlst{if-effects}

However, the simplified stack effect for \factor|if| is quite restrictive.
%
\Verb|( ? true false -- )| \todo{extra space after {\tt ?} with minted}
%
intuitively means that both the \factor|true| and \factor|false| quotations
can't take any inputs or produce any outputs---that their effects are
%
\factor|( -- )|.
%
We'd like to loosen this restriction, but per \cref{sec:primer:effects}, Factor
must know the stack height after the \factor|if| call.  We could give
\factor|if| the effect
%
\Verb|( x ? true false -- y )|,
%
so that the two quotations could each have the stack effect
%
\factor|( x -- y )|.
%
This would work for the \factor|example1| word in \vref{lst:if-effects}, yet
it's just as restrictive.  For instance, the \factor|example2| word would need
\factor|if| to have the effect
%
\Verb|( x y ? true false -- z )|,
%
since each branch has the effect
%
\factor|( x y -- z )|.
%
Furthermore, the quotations might even have different effects, but still leave
the overall stack height balanced.  Only one item is left on the stack after a
call to \factor|example3| regardless, even though the two quotations have
different stack effects: \factor|+| has the effect
%
\factor|( x y -- z )|,
%
while \factor|drop| has the effect
%
\factor|( x -- )|.

In reality, there are infinitely many correct stack effects for \factor|if|.
For these situations, Factor has a special notation for such
\term{row-polymorphic} stack effects.  If a token in a stack effect begins with
two dots, like \factor|..a| or \factor|..b|, it is a \term{row variable}.  If
either side of a stack effect begins with a row variable, it represents any
number inputs/outputs.  Thus, we could give \factor|if| the stack effect
%
\begin{center} \Verb|( ..a ? true false -- ..b )| \end{center}
%
\noindent to indicate that there may be any number of inputs below the
condition on the stack, and any number of outputs will be present after the
call to \factor|if|.  Note that these numbers aren't necessarily equal, which
is why we give each row variable different names in this case.  However, this
still isn't quite enough to capture the stack height requirements.
Specifically, it doesn't communicate that \factor|true| and \factor|false| must
affect the stack in the same ways.  For this, we can use the notation
%
\factor|quot: ( stack -- effect )|,
%
giving quotations a nested stack effect.  We can use the same names for row
variables in both the ``inner'' and ``outer'' stack effects in order to refer
to the same number of inputs or outputs.  Thus, our final (correct) stack
effect for \factor|if| is 
%
\begin{center}
%
  \Verb|( ..a ? true: ( ..a -- ..b ) false: ( ..a -- ..b ) -- ..b )|
%
\end{center}
%
\noindent This tells us that the \factor|true| quotation and the \factor|false|
quotation will each create the same relative change in stack height as
\factor|if| does overall.

\inputlst{loops}

Though \factor|if| is necessarily a language primitive, other control flow
constructs are defined in Factor itself.  Since quotations are basically just
anonymous functions, looping combinators just need to recursively invoke them.
\vref{lst:loops} showcases some common looping patterns.  The most basic, yet
most versatile, is \factor|each|, whose stack effect is
%
\begin{center}
%
  \factor|( ... seq quot: ( ... x -- ... ) -- ... )|
%
\end{center}
%
\noindent Here, unlike with \factor|if|, we enforce that the input stack height
is exactly the same as the output (since we use the same row variable).  So,
each element \factor|x| of \factor|seq| will be passed to \factor|quot|, which
may use any of the underlying stack elements.  As long as the quotation doesn't
push or pop any excess elements, the effect of \factor|each| is balanced.
Thus, the first example in \vref{lst:loops} is equivalent to
%
\begin{center}
%
  \factor|"Lorem" print "ipsum" print "dolor" print|
%
\end{center}
%
\noindent while the second example is the same as
%
\begin{center}
%
  \factor|0 1 + 2 + 3 +|
%
\end{center}
%
\noindent Both leave the stack the same height as at the start: the first with
no items, the second with one (the total sum of the sequence elements).

Any instance of the extensive \factor|sequence| mixin will work with
\factor|each|, making it very flexible.  The third example shows \factor|iota|,
which is used to create a \term{virtual} sequence of integers from $0$ to $9$
(inclusive).  No actual sequence is allocated, merely an object that behaves
like a sequence.  So, it's common practice to use \factor|iota| and
\factor|each| in favor of repetitive C-like \mint{c}|for| loops.

Of course, we sometimes don't need the induction variable in counted loops.
That is, we just want to execute a body of code a certain number of times.  For
these cases, there's the \factor|times| combinator, with the stack effect
%
\begin{center}
%
  \factor|( ... n quot: ( ... -- ... ) -- ... )|
%
\end{center}
%
\noindent This is similar to \factor|each|, except that \factor|n| is a number
(so we needn't use \factor|iota|) and the quotation doesn't expect an extra
argument (like a sequence element) on the stack.  Therefore, the example in
\vref{lst:loops} executes
%
\factor|"Ho!" print|
%
three times.

Naturally, Factor also has the \factor|while| combinator, whose stack effect is
%
\begin{center}
%
  \Verb|( ..a pred: ( ..a -- ..b ? ) body: ( ..b -- ..a ) -- ..b )|
%
\end{center}
%
\noindent The row variables are a bit messy, but it works as you'd expected:
the \factor|pred| quotation is invoked on each iteration to determine whether
\factor|body| should be called.  The \factor|do| word is a handy modifier for
\factor|while| that simply executes the body of the loop once, before leaving
\factor|while| to test the precondition as per usual.
