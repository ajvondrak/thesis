\subsection{Combinators}\label{sec:primer:combinators}

Quotations, introduced in \cref{sec:primer:stack-based}, form the basis of both
control flow and data flow in Factor.  Not only are they the equivalent of
anonymous functions, the stack model makes them syntactically lightweight
enough to serve as blocks of code, akin to the use of curly braces in Java or
C.  The higher-order words that make use of quotations on the stack are called
\term{combinators}.  It's simple to express familiar conditional logic and
loops using combinators, as we'll show in \cref{sec:primer:control-flow}.  In
the presence of explicit data flow via stack operations, even more patterns
arise that can be abstracted away.  \cref{sec:primer:data-flow} explores how we
can use combinators to express otherwise convoluted stack-shuffling logic more
succinctly.
