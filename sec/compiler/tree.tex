\section{High-level Optimizations}\label{sec:compiler:tree}

To manipulate source code abstractly, we must have at least one \gls{IR}---a
data structure representing the instructions.  It's common to convert between
several \glsplural{IR} during compilation, as each form offers different
properties that facilitate particular analyses.  The Factor compiler optimizes
code in passes across two different \glsplural{IR}: first at a high-level using
the \Verb|compiler.tree| vocabulary, then at a low-level with the
\Verb|compiler.cfg| vocabulary.  In this \lcnamecref{sec:compiler:tree}, we
look at the former \gls{IR} and the optimizations performed on it.

\subsection{Representation}

\begin{sloppypar}
The high-level \gls{IR} arranges code into a vector of \Verb|node| objects,
which may themselves have children consisting of vectors of nodes---a tree
structure that lends to the name \Verb|compiler.tree|.  This ordered sequence
of nodes represents control flow in a way that's effectively simple, annotated
stack code.  \Vref{lst:tree} shows the definitions of the tuples that represent
the ``instruction set'' of this stack code.  Each object inherits (directly or
indirectly) from the \Verb|node| class, which itself inherits from
\factor|identity-tuple|.  This is a tuple whose \factor|equal?| method is
defined to always return \factor|f| so that no two instances are equivalent
unless they are the same object in memory.
\end{sloppypar}

\inputlst{tree}

Notice that most nodes define some sort of \Verb|in-d| and \Verb|out-d|
slots, which mark each of them with the input and output data stacks.  This
represents the flow of data through the program.  Here, stack values are
denoted simply by integers, giving each value a unique identifier.  An
\Verb|#introduce| instance is inserted wherever the next node requires stack
values that have not yet been named.  Thus, while \Verb|#introduce| has no
\Verb|in-d|, its \Verb|out-d| introduces the necessary stack values.
Similarly, \Verb|#return| is inserted at the end of the sequence to indicate
the final state of the data stack with its \Verb|in-d| slot.

The most basic operations of a stack language are, of course, pushing literals
and calling functions.  The \Verb|#push| node thus has a \Verb|literal| slot
and an \Verb|out-d| slot, giving a name to the single element it pushes to the
data stack.  \Verb|#call| is used for normal word invocations.  The \Verb|in-d|
and \Verb|out-d| slots effectively serve as the stack effect declaration.  In
later analyses, data about the word's definition may be stored across the
\Verb|body|, \Verb|method|, \Verb|class|, and \Verb|info| slots.

The word \Verb|build-tree| takes a Factor quotation and constructs the
equivalent high-level \gls{IR} form.  In \vref{lst:build-tree-1}, we see the
output of the simple example
%
\factor|[ 1 + ] build-tree|.
%
Note that
%
\factor|T{ class { slot1 value1 } { slot2 value2 } ... }|
%
is the syntax for tuple literals.  The first node is a \Verb|#push| for the
\Verb|1| literal, which is named ``\Verb|6256273|''.  Since \factor|+| needs
two input values, an \Verb|#introduce| pushes a new ``phantom'' value.
\factor|+| gets turned into a \Verb|#call| instance.  The sum is pushed to the
data stack, so the \Verb|out-d| slot is a singleton that names this value.
Finally, \Verb|#return| indicates the end of the routine, its \Verb|in-d|
indicating the value left on the stack (the sum pushed by \Verb|#call|).

\inputlst{build-tree-1}

The next tuples in \vref{lst:tree} reassign existing values on the stack to
fresh identifiers.  The \Verb|#renaming| superclass has the two subclasses
\Verb|#copy| and \Verb|#shuffle|.  The former represents the bijection from
elements of \Verb|in-d| to elements of \Verb|out-d| in the same position;
corresponding values are copies of each other.  Stack shufflers are translated
to more general \Verb|#shuffle| nodes with \Verb|mapping| slots that dictate
how the new values in \Verb|out-d| correspond to the input values in
\Verb|in-d|.  For instance, \vref{lst:build-tree-2} shows how \factor|swap|
takes in the values \Verb|6256132| and \Verb|6256133| and outputs
\Verb|6256134| and \Verb|6256135|, where the first output is mapped to the
second input and the second output is mapped to the first input.  The
\Verb|in-r| and \Verb|out-r| slots of \Verb|#shuffle| correspond to the
\term{retain} stack, which is an implementation detail beyond the scope of this
discussion.

\inputlst{build-tree-2}

\Verb|#declare| is a miscellaneous node used for the \texttt{\textbf{declare}}
primitive.  It simply annotates type information to stack values, as in
\vref{lst:build-tree-3}.  \Verb|#terminate| is another one-off node, but a much
more interesting one.  While Factor normally requires a balanced stack,
sometimes we purposefully want to throw an error.  \Verb|#terminate| is
introduced where the program halts prematurely.  When checking the stack
height, it gets to be treated specially so that \term{terminated} stack effects
unify with any other effect.  That way, branches will still be balanced even if
one of them unconditionally throws an error.  \Vref{lst:build-tree-4} shows
\Verb|#terminate| being introduced by the \factor|throw| word.

\inputlst{build-tree-3}

\inputlst{build-tree-4}

\begin{sloppypar}
Next, \vref{lst:tree} defines nodes for branching based off the superclass
\Verb|#branch|.  The \Verb|children| slot contains vectors of nodes
representing different branches.  \Verb|live-branches| is filled in during
later analyses to indicate which branches might be executed so ``dead'' ones
that are never taken may be removed.  Mostly, we'll see \Verb|#if|, which will
have two elements in its \Verb|children| slot representing the true and false
branches.  On the other hand, \Verb|#dispatch| has an arbitrary number of
children.  It corresponds to the \texttt{\textbf{dispatch}} primitive, which is
an implementation detail of the generic word system used to speed up method
dispatch.
\end{sloppypar}

You may have noted the emphasis on introducing new values, instead of
reassigning old ones.  Even \Verb|#shuffle|s output unique identifiers, letting
their values be determined by the \Verb|mapping|.  The reason for this is that
\Verb|compiler.tree| uses \gls{SSA} form, wherein every variable is defined by
exactly one statement.  This simplifies the properties of variables, which
helps optimizations perform faster and with better results \autocite{SSA}.  By
giving unique names to the targets of each assignment, the \gls{SSA} property
is guaranteed.  However, \Verb|#branch|es introduce ambiguity: after, say, an
\Verb|#if|, what will the \Verb|out-d| be?  It depends on which branch is
taken.  To remedy this problem, after any \Verb|#branch| node, Factor will
place a \Verb|#phi| node---the classical \gls{SSA} ``phony function'', $\phi$.
While it doesn't perform any literal computation, conceptually $\phi$ selects
between its inputs, choosing the ``correct'' argument depending on control
flow.  This can then be assigned to a unique value, preserving the \gls{SSA}
property.  In Factor, a \Verb|#phi| node's arguments are represented by the
\Verb|phi-in-d| slot, which is a sequence of sequences.  Each element
corresponds to the \Verb|out-d| of the respective child of the preceding
\Verb|#branch| node.  The \Verb|#phi|'s \Verb|out-d| gives unique names to the
output values.

For example, the \Verb|#phi| in \vref{lst:build-tree-5} will select between
the \Verb|6256248| return value of the first child or the \Verb|6256249|
output of the second.  Either way, we can refer to the result as
\Verb|6256250| afterwards.  The \Verb|terminated| slot of the \Verb|#phi|
tells us if there was a \Verb|#terminate| in any of the branches.

\inputlst{build-tree-5}

The \Verb|#recursive| node encapsulates \term{inline recursive} words.  In
Factor, words may be annotated with simple compiler declarations, which guide
optimizations.  If we follow a standard colon definition with the
\factor|inline| word, we're saying that its definition can be spliced into the
call site, rather than generating code to jump to a subroutine.  Inline words
that call themselves must additionally be declared \factor|recursive|.  For
example, we could write
%
\factor|: foo ( -- ) foo ; inline recursive|.
%
The nodes \Verb|#enter-recursive|, \Verb|#call-recursive|, and
\Verb|#return-recursive| denote different stages of the recursion---the
beginning, recursive call, and end, respectively.  They carry around a lot of
metadata about the nature of the recursion, but it doesn't serve our purposes
to get into the details.  Similarly, we gloss over the final nodes of
\vref{lst:tree}, which correspond to Factor's \gls{FFI} vocabulary, called
\Verb|alien|.  At a high level, \Verb|#alien-node|, \Verb|#alien-invoke|,
\Verb|#alien-indirect|, \Verb|#alien-assembly|, and \Verb|#alien-callback| are
used to make calls to C libraries from within Factor.

\subsection{Optimizations}

Now that we're familiar with the structure of the high-level \gls{IR}, we can
turn our attention to optimization.  \Vref{lst:optimize-tree} shows the passes
performed on a sequence of nodes by the word \Verb|optimize-tree|.  Before
optimization can begin, we must gather some information and clean up some
oddities in the output of \Verb|build-tree|.  \Verb|analyze-recursive| is
called first to identify and mark loops in the tree.  Effectively, this means
we detect loops introduced by \Verb|#recursive| nodes.  Future passes can then
use this information for data flow analysis.  Afterwards, \Verb|normalize|
makes the tree more consistent by doing two things:
%
\begin{itemize}
%
  \item All \Verb|#introduce| nodes are removed and replaced by a single
        \Verb|#introduce| at the beginning of the whole program.  This way,
        further passes needn't handle \Verb|#introduce| nodes.
%
  \item As constructed, the \Verb|in-d| of a \Verb|#call-recursive| will be
        the entire stack at the time of the call.  This assumption happens
        because we don't know how many inputs it needs until the
        \Verb|#return-recursive| is processed, because of row polymorphism
        (refer to \cref{sec:primer:combinators}).  So, here we figure out
        exactly what stack entries are needed, and trim the \Verb|in-d| and
        \Verb|out-d| of each \Verb|#call-recursive| accordingly.
%
\end{itemize}

\inputlst{optimize-tree}

Once these passes have cleaned up the tree, \Verb|propagate| performs probably
the most extensive analysis of all the phases.  In short, it performs an
extended version of \gls{SCCP} \autocite{SCCP}.  The traditional data flow
analysis combines global copy propagation, constant propagation, and constant
folding in a \term{flow-sensitive} way.  That is, it will propagate information
from branches that it knows are definitely taken (e.g., because \Verb|#if| is
always given a true input).  Instead of using the typical single-level
(numeric) constant value lattice, Factor uses a lattice augmented by
information about numeric value ranges, array lengths/bounds, and classes
(which form a partial order, as described briefly in \cref{sec:primer:oo}).
Additionally, the pass may inline certain calls if enough information is
present.  As values are refined, they propagate to other values that depend on
them.  For example, by refining the range of possible values a particular
numeric variable can have, we might discover that, say, it's small enough to
fit in a \factor|fixnum| rather than a \factor|bignum|.  Then a math operator
called on it may be inlined to a more specific version.  Or, if the interval
has zero length, we may replace the value with a constant, which contributes to
constant folding.

\Verb|propagate| iterates through the nodes collecting all of this data until
reaching a stable point where inferences can no longer be drawn.  Technically,
this information doesn't alter the tree at all; we merely store it so that
speculative decisions may be realized later.  The next word in
\vref{lst:optimize-tree}, \Verb|cleanup|, does just this by inlining words,
folding constants, removing overflow checks, deleting unreachable branches, and
flattening inline-recursive words that don't actually wind up calling
themselves (e.g., because the calls got constant-folded).

The next major pass is \Verb|escape-analysis|, whose information is used for
the actual transformation \Verb|unbox-tuples|.  This discovers tuples that
\term{escape} by getting passed outside of a word.  For instance, the inputs to
\Verb|#return| obviously escape, as they are passed to the world outside of the
word in question.  Similarly, inputs to the \Verb|#call| of another word
escape.  So, though the tuples in \Verb|escaping-via-#return| and
\Verb|escaping-via-#call| in \vref{lst:escaping} both escape, we can see the
one in \Verb|non-escaping| does not.  Because it does not escape to another
location that may potentially use it, the last allocation is unnecessary.  By
identifying this, \Verb|unbox-tuples| can then rewrite the code to avoid
allocating a \Verb|data-struct| altogether, instead manipulating the slots'
values directly.  Note that this only happens for immutable tuples, all of
whose slots are \factor|read-only|.  Otherwise, we would need to perform more
advanced pointer analyses to discover aliases.

\inputlst{escaping}

\Verb|apply-identities| follows to simplify words with known identity elements.
If, say, one argument to \factor|+| is \Verb|0|, we can simply return the other
argument.  This converts the \Verb|#call| to \factor|+| into a simple
\Verb|#shuffle|.  These identities are defined for most arithmetic words.

Another few simple passes come next in \vref{lst:optimize-tree}.  True to its
name, \Verb|compute-def-use| computes where \gls{SSA} values are defined and
used.  Values that are never used are eliminated by \Verb|remove-dead-code|.
\Verb|?check| conditionally performs some consistency checks on the tree,
mostly to make sure that no errors were introduced in the stack flow.  If a
global variable isn't toggled on, this part is skipped.  We run
\Verb|compute-def-use| again to update the information after altering the tree
with dead code elimination.

Finally, \Verb|optimize-modular-arithmetic| performs a form of
strength-reduction on arithmetic words that only use the low-order bits of
their inputs/results, which may also remove unnecessary overflow checks.
\Verb|finalize| cleans up a few random miscellaneous bits of the tree (removing
empty shufflers, deleting \Verb|#copy| nodes, etc.) in preparation for
lower-level optimizations.
