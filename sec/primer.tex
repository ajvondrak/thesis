\chapter{Language Primer}\label{sec:primer}

Factor is a rather young language created by Slava Pestov in September 2003
\autocite{young-factor}.  Its first incarnation was an embedded scripting
language for a game that targeted the \gls{JVM}.  As such, its feature set was
minimal.  Factor has since evolved into a general-purpose programming language,
gaining new features and redesigning old ones as necessary for larger programs.
Today's implementation sports an extensive standard library and has moved away
from the \gls{JVM} in favor of native code generation.  In this
\lcnamecref{sec:primer}, we cover the basic syntax and semantics of Factor for
those unfamiliar with the language.  This should be just enough to understand
the later material in this thesis.  More thorough documentation can be found
via Factor's website, \url{http://factorcode.org}.
