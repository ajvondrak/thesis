\section{Language Primer}\label{sec:primer}

Factor is a rather young language created by Slava Pestov in September of 2003.
Its first incarnation targeted the \gls{JVM} as an embedded scripting language
for a game.  As such, its feature set was minimal.  Factor has since evolved
into a general-purpose programming language, gaining new features and
redesigning old ones as necessary for larger programs.  Today's implementation
sports an extensive standard library and has moved away from the \gls{JVM} in
favor of native code generation.  In this \lcnamecref{sec:primer}, we cover the
basic syntax and semantics of Factor for those unfamiliar with the language.
This should be just enough to understand the later material in this thesis.
More thorough documentation can be found via Factor's website,
